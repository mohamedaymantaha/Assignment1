a. $ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

b. 5 commits. I used git log to know this.

c. Thursday, January 10 16:45:38 2019. I used the command git log -- .gitignore

d. One reason for using branches is so you don't end up editing the master.
 The master branch is what's deployable in the end. Another reason is it  
 provides organizational benefits for the developer.

e. git status displays which changes have been staged. whereas git log
displays a record of such commits.

f. git log Weapon.h

g. git grep file

h. I. Inheritance is the idea that new data types can be defined as extensions
of previously defined types, rather than having to be defined from scratch.
II. Polymorphism is the concept that objects of different types can be accessed 
through the same interface.
III. Encapsulation is the gathering into one unit of all aspects of the real-world
entity modeled by that unit.

i. The "Dictator and Lieutenants" workflow is where development is distributed between
a few Lieutenant repositories and one "Dictator" repository in order to only allow any
changes to be pushed by the Dictator. A "Centralized" workflow is where each developer
pulls changes in the central repository and pushes them back into the central repository,
with all developers working at one shared repository.

j. The "Dictator and Lieutenants" workflow is much more suitable to a big team of 
developers than the "Centralized" workflow because it would be much more organized
to manage each change at once through one individual repository instead of every
developer pushing and pulling from the main repository. Much more efficient in
management and time.

5. It is using polymorphism because the weapons are different and yet they are all accessed
through the same template. It's also using encapsulation by the way the armor points system
is modeled.
